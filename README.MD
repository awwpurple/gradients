## A Conjugate Gradients Method for finding the minimum of quadratic function

### What is it about?

Optimization methods allow solving many problems of finding the optimal solution:
finding the optimal technology, geometric design, time of technological processes and similar problems in various fields
of science and technology. Often in such applied problems there is a problem of finding exactly the minimum of a
function, for example, finding the minimum of error, fault, and the like. For this reason, in this project, the problem of
finding the minimum is considered, in addition, it is not difficult to pass to the problem of finding the maximum.

This project contains three methods: Steepest Decent, Conjugate Gradients and Conjugate Gradients with Secant and Polak-Ribiere for quadratic function.


### How to use?
Data entry for Steepest Decent and Conjugate Gradients methods carried out programmatically in the main function.

Data entry for the Polak-Ribi√®re method is carried out through a file [input.txt](input), all values of vectors and matrices should be entered with a space.
The results are output to a file [output.txt](output).
